This repository demonstrates a subtle CSS specificity bug. The primary issue involves unexpected styling overrides due to selector specificity. The bug.css file contains the erroneous code, and bugSolution.css provides the corrected version with explanations. The bug stems from the higher specificity of a more general selector unexpectedly overriding a more specific selector.  The solution addresses this by restructuring the CSS rules to ensure the intended styles are applied.
